have a drop down option especially for product, also title for the 

profile page missing (let user edit their preferences, user info, etc)

there should be no buttons for the titles of the table

usage should be asked by the user to rate, like how frequently they think they will use the product, so usability on scale of 1-5, so 5 rated product will be given high priority for repurchase


suggestions page separate - it should show siggestions with help of AI so what to buy, not buy, recipes, etc

when showing the products the section should be Your products

asking users their name/what should we call you at onboarding to display in place of Hi User Name!


the table should be like airtable so user can use filters to select partuclar category, sort, etc
